    innovativeness: "Design Alternative 1 The first design that was looked at is shown
      below in Figure 1: DesignAlternative 1. This design employs the use of a high
      wing attached to aconventional single-engine type fuselage finished off with
      a standard tailto control elevation. The main advantage behind using this design
      is itssolid foundation. In turbulent or otherwise undesirable conditions duringflight,
      the struts connecting the wings to the fuselage prevent any damagefrom occurring
      and also aid in supporting a steady flight path. Its\u201Cteardrop\u201D shape
      also adds a great deal to the plane\u2019s aerodynamicsby cutting down on its
      drag coefficient. The disadvantages in using thisdesign, however, stem mostly
      from the desired specifications of the planeitself. Since this plane is being
      designed to perform a reconnaissancemission the best place to mount a camera
      to provide feedback of locationand target recognition is in the nose; but the
      body of this design alsorequires a front-centered propeller which would conflict
      with theelectronics powering the camera, as well as the camera itself. Figure
      1: Design Alternative 1Design Alternative 2 The second design that was considered
      can be seen in Figure 2: DesignAlternative 2. This design proposes a middle-wing
      configuration, attachedto a fuselage that is rounded towards the front to be
      able to contain allof the electrical components, but thins out until it is met
      with a t-tailthat is used to stabilize its flight. This design has great aerodynamiccapabilities
      due to the shape of its fuselage and long, thin, and rigidwings. The extended
      wingspan also allows for greater overall lift with theleast amount of drag,
      which means that a greater load may also besupported. Also with the removal
      of the support struts, this design issignificantly lighter than the previously
      suggested design. But althoughthere are a lot of valuable aspects, the same
      problem arises, and that isthe location of the motor. Due to the fact that the
      fuselage thins out somuch towards the rear of the plane, it is feasible to place
      a propellerthere. So while the aerodynamics were significantly improved upon
      with thisdesign, the fact that this is still a plane requiring a front-centeredpropeller
      takes away from its feasibility for the desired specifications. \_ \_ \_ \_
      \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_
      Figure 2:Design Alternative 2Design Alternative 3 (Concept design obtained from
      a movie) The third design, seen below in Figure 3: Design Alternative 3 has
      becomeour most favoured design for UAV technology today. This design consists
      ofa glider-type fuselage that has a round nose that is lofted into a thin,circular
      shape that is met by a V-tail used for increased maneuverability.Similar long,
      thin, rigid wings are seen in this design as were seen in theglider. The difference
      between this design and that of the glider comesfrom its extended fuselage,
      which allows for a back-centered propeller tobe used. This is a significant
      improvement from the other designs, becauseit allows for the camera to be placed
      in the nose of the Plane, as well as all of the other electrical components,
      without beinginterfered with by the propeller.Figure 3: Design Alternative 3Proposed
      DesignAfter looking into many possible options and comparing the pros and consbetween
      overall weight, flight time, it was decided that the 3rd designalternative was
      the best design to go with. With its rigid frame, lightweight, and adherence
      to design criterion this plane was the best possiblechoice to use to enter into
      the competition next year, the last thing thatneeds to be decided upon is the
      type of engine that will be used to fly it.There are both positive and negative
      aspects related to an electrical motorand a gasoline powered motor, the greatest
      factor rests in the weight thatwould be added to the system. Once an estimate
      on the weight of all of theinternal components for the on-board autopilot, batteries
      and processingequipment is received a decision will be made on the type of engine
      to beused for this design."

    revenuestream: Our business model is built upon the constant revenue stream fromsubscription
      based UAV usage. We believe that the customer needs ourproduct to offer better
      service themselves, but thanks for today's highcost of industry grade level
      UAV-s, they most times opt out. This is why wethink that pay-by-flighthour service
      meets their need better thanconventional means. This gives us a constant revenue
      stream from multiplecompanies faster and reduces the risk of not making the
      first sale, becausethe customer has already a lower risk to its business. This
      is vital inbringing down the operating costs for our todays and future clients.
    marketpenetrationstrategy: Our main market penetration strategy is to be unique
      and think about UAV-sand its use cases differently. We believe in educating
      the customer and enduser by investing time into them. We are in constant contact
      with thepotential customers and offer them different demos with our products.
      Weare highly willing to modify to meet the customer needs. Our marketstrategy
      is highly aggressive compared to our competitors. We believe it istime for a
      change in the UAV market.
    marketingplanandstrategy: Our marketing plan and strategy is direct sales and
      tenders only. Weidentify problems in the field and customers who are related
      to it. Wetweak and redesign our products to meet the needs of the user. After
      thisis done we schedule a demo with the potential customer to find out more.
      Wemap out everything we need to know and make the offer to the customer.
